## Greetings
I want to thank Dharam Dhurandhar for his [Arch Linux Splash Screen](https://store.kde.org/p/1526375/), which was the starting point of this project. Also my dad, that's a huge ispiration for me!
## Installation
Download the .zip file specified in the release section, and  extract in a radom folder.
Then, download Dharam's Splash Screen. Make sure it has this name:

Then go to
>/home/USERNAME/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/

Where USERNAME is, of course, your username.
This is the folder where your splash screen will be. Copy the content of the release into the Arch-Splash-Screen folder and rename it as you like (I suggest to rename it as Juventus or JuveSplash for better identification).
